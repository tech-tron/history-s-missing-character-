    I  had a thought, dear
    However scary
    About that night
    The bugs and the dirt
    Why were you digging?
    What did you bury
    Before those hands pulled me
    From the earth?
    I will not ask you where you came from
    I will not ask you, neither should you
    Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
    We should just kiss like real people do
    I knew that look dear
    Eyes always seeking
    Was there in someone
    That dug long ago
    So I will not ask you
    Why you were creeping
    In some sad way I already know
    I will not ask you where you came from
    I willâ€¦
